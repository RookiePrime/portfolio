# Portfolio Website

## What is This?
My full stack development portfolio page. It will, in due time, link to all my various impressive projects. And possibly some unimpressive ones too!

## Will it be Professional?
One day. One day...

## What skills does it showcase?
Right now, HTML, CSS and Javascript, and one of my projects is a little React-based thingydoodle. But more will come, both in my understanding of different technologies and in my understandings of the ones I know already.

## Well Where is it, Then?
